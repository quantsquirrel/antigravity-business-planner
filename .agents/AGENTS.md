# .agents

## Purpose
Extended skills directory containing newer, more comprehensive skills added after initial setup. These skills are symlinked into `.agent/skills/` for unified access by the Antigravity agent.

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `skills/` | Extended skill packages: launch-strategy, pricing-strategy, startup-metrics-framework (see `skills/AGENTS.md`) |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Skills here are accessed via symlinks from `.agent/skills/`
- Each skill follows the same SKILL.md convention as `.agent/skills/`
- These skills tend to be more detailed and SaaS-oriented compared to the core skills
