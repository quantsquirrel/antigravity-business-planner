# skills

## Purpose
Extended skill packages with comprehensive, SaaS-oriented frameworks. These are symlinked into `.agent/skills/` for unified access. Added after initial project setup to expand the tool's capabilities beyond traditional business planning.

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `launch-strategy/` | ORB framework, 5-phase launch approach, Product Hunt strategy, post-launch marketing (see `launch-strategy/AGENTS.md`) |
| `pricing-strategy/` | Value-based pricing, tier design, freemium vs. trial, enterprise pricing, Van Westendorp research (see `pricing-strategy/AGENTS.md`) |
| `startup-metrics-framework/` | KPI tracking, unit economics, CAC/LTV, burn multiple, Rule of 40 (see `startup-metrics-framework/AGENTS.md`) |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- These skills are the canonical source; `.agent/skills/` symlinks point here
- Skills here are English-authored but should produce Korean output per rules
- `launch-strategy` and `pricing-strategy` are self-contained in SKILL.md
- `startup-metrics-framework` has additional resources in `resources/`
